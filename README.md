# Automating-input-file-generation-for-NAMD-simulation

# The scirpt is capable of doing the following task

- Automates PSF file generation
- Performs solvation and ionization
- Calculates box size for simulations
- Generates restraint files
- Creates configuration files for minimization, annealing, equilibration, and production steps
- Generates plots for total energy, potential energy, kinetic energy, temperature, volume, and pressure using log files from NAMD
- Provides a bash script for running molecular dynamics simulations
